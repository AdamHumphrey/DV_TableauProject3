##Summary of data



###Sheet 1
![My Figure](./sheet1.png)

Sheet 1 shows a bullet chart of the total ammo trades in USD overlaid in color by the total article leather trades in USD for countries filtered such that only countries with total ammo trades greater than 5.7 billion are shown.To reproduce the picture above in tableau, place "Ammo Country Area" in "Rows" and "SUM(Ammo Trade Usd)" in "Columns". Then place "SUM(Al Trade Usd)" in "Marks" and select the "Bar" graph option. Then place another "SUM(Al Trade Usd)" into "Color" under in "Marks". This will bring up a legend with a color gradient. Right click on that legend and select "**Edit Colors**" and then under the "Palette" option, pick "Orange-Blue Diverging" and press OK. Next, right click the "SUM(Ammo Trade Usd)" in the "Columns" section and select "**Filter...**". Select "Range of values" and move the lower bound to 5.7 billion and press OK. Next click the Ammo Trade Usd axis at the bottem of the visualization and select "Add Reference Line, Band, or Box." Select "Line". Under "scope" select Per Cell. Under "Line", change "Value:" from "SUM(Ammo Trade Usd)" to "SUM(Al Trade Usd)" and change "Average" to "Sum", finally change "Label:" to "None". Under "formatting" change "Line:" to "None" and change "Fill Below:" to a light gray.

###Sheet 2
![My Figure2](./sheet2.png)

Sheet 2 shows a bubble graph, where the size of the bubbles represents the amount of article leather quantity traded by a particular mode (modes such as Export,Import,ect...) by a particular country. The trade modes are color coded with blue for export, orange for imports, green for re-exports and red for re-imports. To reproduce this visualization, place "Ammo Flow" into "Color" and place "SUM(Al Quantity)" into "Size" in "Marks" . Then select the "Circle" option under "Marks". Next, place "Ammo Flow" and, after making sure that "Al Country Area" is linked to "Ammo Country Area", place "Al Country Area" it into "Label" in "Marks". Next, right click on "Al Country Area", and select "**Filter...**" and unselect "Null" in the "General" tab, and press OK. Finally, right click "SUM(Al Quantity)" and select "**Filter...**", choose "Special" and select "Non-null values" and press OK.
